### Justification for Using Cypress Framework

1. **Ease of Use**:
   -  Cypress is easy to set up without requiring complex configurations or dependencies. It automatically bundles all necessary components for end-to-end (E2E) testing, making it accessible even for beginners.
   - Cypress comes with built-in assertions, which makes it straightforward to write readable and maintainable tests without needing additional libraries.
   - Cypress automatically waits for elements to load, DOM changes, and requests to resolve, eliminating the need for manual waits (`sleep` or `wait` commands) and reducing flaky tests.

2. **Fast and Real-Time Feedback**:
   - The interactive test runner allows users to watch tests as they execute in real-time, providing immediate feedback. This makes debugging easier since you can see what happens step-by-step.
   - Cypress records snapshots of your application during test execution, allowing you to "time travel" through different states of your app and inspect elements directly in the Cypress GUI.

3. **Comprehensive Testing Features**:
   - Cypress excels at E2E testing and can interact with the browser the same way users would, including handling real user actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, etc.
   - While primarily known for E2E testing, Cypress also supports unit and integration testing, making it a versatile choice.
   - Cypress supports testing APIs by allowing HTTP requests with its `cy.request()` command, making it easy to validate backend services.
   - With tools like `cy.intercept()`, Cypress makes it simple to stub network requests and mock APIs, which is essential for testing components in isolation or scenarios with complex dependencies.

4. **Strong Community Support**:
   - Cypress has a large and active community that provides support through forums, GitHub issues, and numerous tutorials. This strong community presence makes learning and troubleshooting much easier.
   - The official Cypress documentation is well-written, comprehensive, and easy to navigate, making it simple to find guidance on how to perform various testing tasks.
   - Cypress has a rich ecosystem of third-party plugins and libraries that enhance testing capabilities, such as reporting tools, additional assertion libraries, and integrations with CI/CD pipelines.

5. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
   - Cypress supports testing on multiple browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. This ensures that your web applications work consistently across different environments, though it currently has limited support for Safari.

6. **Continuous Integration (CI) Friendly**:
   - Cypress integrates seamlessly with popular CI tools like Jenkins, GitLab, CircleCI, and others. It supports parallel test execution and also provides a Cypress Dashboard for test result tracking in CI environments.
